# FRCStats

[dracco1993.github.io/FRCStats/](https://dracco1993.github.io/FRCStats/)

A website that lists all the matches for a given FRC district at champs.

## About

- What's with the repo name?

  - Well... 5 years ago I started this project with the intention of creating a comprehensive FRC statistics tool, but I quickly realized that I didn't have the time to do that. So, I decided to start small and build a simple tool that would allow me to quickly see the champs matches for a given FRC district. At the time, I was planning on expanding this tool to include more features, but since then, fantastic tools like [Statbotics](https://www.statbotics.io/) have been released, so it's likely just going to remain a simple champs match listing tool.

- Code quality?

  - It's... not great. I threw together this project 5 years ago, and, compared to now, I had no clue what I was doing back then. I've been meaning to refactor it, but somewhere between "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" and "I just haven't had the time", I haven't. So, if you're looking for a good example of how not to write code, this is it.

- Update frequency?

  - I've been incrementally updating this project over the years, but it's usually the week before champs each year (in 2022 it was literally on a charter bus to champs).

- Why is it hosted on GitHub Pages?

  - It's free, and it's easy. I don't have to worry about hosting, and it's a simple way to get the project out there.

- Why is it just now being open-sourced?
  - I've been meaning to open-source this project [for a while now](https://github.com/dracco1993/FRCStats/issues/19), but I just haven't gotten around to it. As mentioned previously, the code is... not great, but I've had quite a few people ask me about it, so I figured I'd finally get around to it.

## Development

FRCStats is powered by [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/) and [FRC Colors](https://frc-colors.com/) using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.

The backend is... nonexistent. All the heavy lifting is done on the frontend, which isn't great, I know, but spare dev time is hard to come by, especially during peak FRC season.

## Contributing
